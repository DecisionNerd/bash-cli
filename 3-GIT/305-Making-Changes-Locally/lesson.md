# 305. Making Changes Locally

## Learning Objectives

- Open and edit files in a cloned repository
- Save changes using a text editor

## Introduction

After cloning a repository, you can make changes to the files on your local machine. This lesson covers how to open, edit, and save files in your project.

---

## 1. Opening Files and Making Edits

- Use a text editor (e.g., VS Code, nano, vim, Notepad) to open files in your repository folder.
- Make the desired changes (e.g., add a line, fix a typo).

---

## 2. Saving Changes

- Save the file in your editor (usually File > Save or Ctrl+S / Cmd+S).
- The changes are now on your local machine, but not yet tracked by Git.

---

## Practical Exercise

1. Open a file in your cloned repository using your favorite text editor.
2. Make a small change (e.g., add a comment or line).
3. Save the file.
4. Use `git status` to see that the file has been modified.
