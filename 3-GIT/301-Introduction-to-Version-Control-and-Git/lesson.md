# 301. Introduction to Version Control and Git

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept and benefits of version control
- Explain what Git and GitHub are
- Relate version control to real-world analogies

## Introduction

Version control is a system that records changes to files over time, allowing you to recall specific versions later. It is essential for collaboration, backup, and tracking progress in any project.

---

## 1. What is Version Control?

Version control lets you:

- Track changes to files
- Revert to previous versions
- Collaborate with others without overwriting work

**Analogy:** Like saving multiple versions of a document so you can go back if needed.

## 2. What is Git? What is GitHub?

- **Git** is a popular version control system used to manage code and other files.
- **GitHub** is a website that hosts Git repositories online, making collaboration easy.

## Practical Exercise

1. Think of a scenario where you lost changes to a file. How could version control have helped?
2. Research a popular open-source project on GitHub and note how many contributors it has.
