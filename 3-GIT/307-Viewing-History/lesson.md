# 307. Viewing History

## Learning Objectives

- View the commit history of a repository
- Understand commit messages and IDs

## Introduction

Git keeps a record of every change made to your project. You can view this history to see what was changed, when, and by whom. This lesson covers how to view and interpret commit history.

---

## 1. Viewing Commit History

See a list of all commits in your repository.

```sh
git log
```

- Press `q` to exit the log view.

---

## 2. Understanding Commit Messages and IDs

- Each commit has a unique ID (hash) and a message describing the change.
- The log shows the author, date, and message for each commit.

---

## Practical Exercise

1. Run `git log` in your repository to view the commit history.
2. Identify the most recent commit message and its ID.
3. Note the author and date of a commit.
