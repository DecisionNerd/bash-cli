# Playground Rules

Welcome to the PLAYGROUND directory! This is your dedicated workspace to practice and complete exercises for all three modules of this course.

- Feel free to experiment, create, and modify files here as you work through the lessons.
- If you are comfortable with Git, you can use lesson-specific branches (named after the lesson number) to reset the PLAYGROUND to a clean state for each lesson. For example, to start fresh for lesson 102, you can switch to the corresponding branch:

  ```bash
  git checkout lesson-102
  ```

  This will provide you with a clean version of the PLAYGROUND for that lesson.

Happy learning and experimenting!
