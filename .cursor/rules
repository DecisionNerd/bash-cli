# Cursor Rules for Refactoring lesson.md Files

1. **Lesson Structure:**

   - All `lesson.md` files must follow this structure:
     - `# {{TITLE}}`
     - `## 📝 Summary` (1–2 paragraphs expanding the provided summary)
     - `## 🎯 Learning Objectives` (3–5 bullet points referencing previous, current, and next lesson skills)
     - `## 📚 Lesson Content` (clear, concise, scaffolded explanations with headings/subheadings)
     - `## 💡 Guided Examples` (at least 2 fully worked, step-by-step examples, referencing the PLAYGROUND folder)
     - `## 🧪 Practice Exercises` (3–5+ exercises, building on previous lessons and using the PLAYGROUND folder)
     - `## ✅ Progress Check (Optional)` (instructions for creating a marker file in the PLAYGROUND folder to verify lesson completion)

2. **Cumulative Learning:**

   - Each lesson should reinforce skills from previous lessons and set up for the next, as reflected in objectives, content, and exercises.
   - Use a friendly, direct instructional tone.

3. **Playground Integration:**

   - Examples and exercises must reference or use files in the `PLAYGROUND/` folder, encouraging hands-on practice.
   - Suggest branch-based workflows for resetting the playground as needed (see `PLAYGROUND/1-RULES.md`).

4. **Test Script Requirement:**

   - Each lesson folder **must include a shell script** (e.g., `test_basic_navigation.sh` or `test_basic_file_management.sh`) that tests completion of the lesson.
   - The test script must:
     - Be located in the **same folder** as the corresponding `lesson.md` file.
     - Use the `PLAYGROUND/` folder for all exercises and for verifying completion (e.g., by checking for marker files or exercise artifacts).
     - Be idempotent and safe to run multiple times.
     - Clearly report which checks pass or fail.

5. **Consistency and Clarity:**

   - Use Markdown syntax with clear headings, code blocks, and bullet points.
   - Ensure all sections are present and coherent across the lesson series.
   - Relate explanations to the overall course roadmap (see module READMEs).

6. **Documentation Alignment:**

   - Refactoring must align with the project's mission and architecture as described in the main `README.md` and module READMEs.
   - Enhance features and roadmap as documented, ensuring lessons are modular and suitable for both self-learners and classroom use.

7. **No Extra Output:**
   - Only output the revised `lesson.md` content and required test script—no explanations or meta-commentary.
