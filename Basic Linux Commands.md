## Shells

A shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system by typing commands. It acts as an intermediary between the user and the system, interpreting and executing commands, running scripts, and managing processes.

We can check our current shell by running: `echo $SHELL`
### sh

Bourne Shell. The original Unix shell, created by Stephen Bourne. It's simple, widely available, and very portable but lacks some of the advanced features found in more modern shells.

**SYNTAX:**

```bash
sh [COMMAND]
```

### bash

Bourne Again Shell. A more feature-rich and popular shell, Bash is an enhanced version of SH, offering improvements like command-line editing, history, and scripting features. It's the default shell on many Linux distributions and macOS (before zsh).

**SYNTAX:**

```bash
bash [COMMAND]
```

### zsh

An extended version of Bash, Zsh adds features like improved tab completion, better globbing, and more customization options. It's highly favored for interactive use due to its rich features, and has become the default shell on macOS since Catalina.

**SYNTAX:**

```bash
zsh [COMMAND]
```

### fish

Friendly Interactive Shell. A modern shell designed to be user-friendly, with features like syntax highlighting, auto-suggestions, and an intuitive scripting syntax. Fish emphasizes ease of use over compatibility with other shells but breaks compatibility with many scripts.

**SYNTAX:**

```bash
fish [COMMAND]
```

### history

Display command history. History is saved to a local hidden file usually located in the home directory and will have a different name depending on the shell being used.

**SYNTAX:**

```bash
history [OPTION]
```

**OPTIONS**:
`-c`
	Clears bash history

**FILES:**
`.history`
`.bash_history`
`.zsh_history`
`.fish_history`

### Redirections `<` and `>`

Redirect input and output to and from files.

**SYNTAX:**

```bash
command > file # Send output of the command to file
command >> file # Append output of the command to file
command1 < command2 # send output of command2 to the input of command1 
```

**EXAMPLES:**

```bash
# Redirects the output of `ls` to `output.txt`.
ls > output.txt

# Reads from `input.txt` and sends it to the `cat` command.
cat < input.txt
```

### IO Streams `0 1 2`

Standard input, output, and error.

**SYNTAX:**

```bash
command 1> output.txt 2> error.txt
```

**EXAMPLES:**

```bash
# Redirects standard output to `output.txt` and standard error to `error.txt`.
command 1> output.txt 2> error.txt
```
### Pipes `|`

Send output of one command to another.

**SYNTAX:**

```bash
command1 | command2
```

**EXAMPLES:**

```bash
# Filters the output of `ls` through `grep` to find matches.
ls | grep "pattern"
```

### Command separators `;` and `&&`

The `;` (semi-colon) is used to split multiple commands on a single line that will be ran sequentially in order. The `&&` does the same but will only continue if the previous command succeeded.

**SYNTAX:**

```bash
command1; command2
command1 && command2
```

**EXAMPLES:**

```bash
# Executes `echo "Hello"` and `echo "World"` sequentially.
echo "Hello"; echo "World"

# Creates a directory and, if successful, run cd to change into it.
mkdir newdir && cd newdir
```

### Command substitution `` ` `` and `$()`

Use the output of one command as input to another.

**SYNTAX:**

```bash
result=$(command)
result=`command`
```

**EXAMPLES:**

```bash
Assigns the current date to the variable CURRENT_DATE.
CURRENT_DATE=$(date)
```
