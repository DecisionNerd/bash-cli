# 108. Process Management

## üìù Summary

Process management is essential for controlling running programs, troubleshooting, and optimizing system performance. In this lesson, you'll learn how to view, control, and manage processes and jobs in Linux.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

- List and inspect running processes
- Send signals to processes (stop, continue, kill)
- Manage background and foreground jobs
- Practice process management in the `PLAYGROUND/processes/` directory

## üìö Lesson Content

### What is a Process?

A process is a running instance of a program. Linux allows you to view, control, and manage these processes using various commands.

---

### Linux Signals

- `SIGINT` (CTRL+C): Interrupt
- `SIGSTOP` (CTRL+Z): Pause
- `SIGCONT`: Resume
- `SIGKILL` (9): Force kill

---

### `ps` ‚Äî Show Processes

Lists running processes.

**Syntax:**

```bash
ps [OPTIONS]
```

**Examples:**

```bash
ps aux
ps -u $USER
```

---

### `lsof` ‚Äî List Open Files

Shows files opened by processes.

**Syntax:**

```bash
lsof [OPTIONS]
```

**Example:**

```bash
lsof -i
```

---

### `kill` ‚Äî Terminate Process

Sends a signal to a process to terminate or control it.

**Syntax:**

```bash
kill [OPTIONS] <PID>
```

**Examples:**

```bash
kill 1234
kill -9 1234
kill -SIGCONT 1234
```

---

### `killall` ‚Äî Kill by Name

Sends a signal to all processes with a given name.

**Syntax:**

```bash
killall [OPTIONS] <NAME>
```

**Examples:**

```bash
killall firefox
killall -9 firefox
```

---

### `wait` ‚Äî Wait for Process

Waits for a process to finish.

```bash
wait [PID]
```

---

### `sleep` ‚Äî Pause Execution

Pauses for a specified number of seconds.

```bash
sleep <SECONDS>
```

---

### `jobs` ‚Äî List Jobs

Lists background and stopped jobs in the current shell.

```bash
jobs
```

---

### `fg` and `bg` ‚Äî Foreground/Background Jobs

- `fg [JOB_ID]`: Bring a job to the foreground
- `bg [JOB_ID]`: Resume a job in the background

---

## üí° Guided Examples

1. In the `PLAYGROUND/processes/` directory, start a background job:
   ```bash
   sleep 30 &
   ```
2. List running jobs:
   ```bash
   jobs
   ```
3. Bring the job to the foreground:
   ```bash
   fg %1
   ```
4. Start another background job and kill it:
   ```bash
   sleep 60 &
   kill %2
   ```

---

## üß™ Practice Exercises

1. **List Processes:**
   - Use `ps` to list all processes and redirect the output to `ps_output.txt` in `PLAYGROUND/processes/`.
2. **Start and Kill a Job:**
   - Start a background job with `sleep 10 &` and use `jobs` to confirm it's running. Kill it with `kill` or `kill %<job_number>`.
3. **Open Files:**
   - Use `lsof` to list open files and redirect the output to `lsof_output.txt` in `PLAYGROUND/processes/`.

---

## ‚úÖ Progress Check (Optional)

After completing the exercises, create a marker file named `.process_check` in `PLAYGROUND/processes/`:

```bash
touch PLAYGROUND/processes/.process_check
```

This helps automated scripts verify your progress in this lesson.
